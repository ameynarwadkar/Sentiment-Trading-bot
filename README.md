   - Inside the on_trading_iteration method, it calculates position size, retrieves sentiment, 
     and decides whether to buy, sell, or hold based on sentiment analysis results and available cash.

5. Backtesting:
   - Sets start and end dates for backtesting.
   - Initializes Alpaca broker and MLTrader strategy with specified parameters.
   - Executes backtesting using YahooDataBacktesting class.

   - Utilizes sentiment analysis to determine the probability and sentiment (positive/negative) of the news.

5. Trading Decision:
   - Decides whether to buy or sell based on the sentiment analysis results and available cash.
   - Implements a bracket order with take-profit and stop-loss prices.

6. Backtesting:

Conclusion:
The MLTrader strategy utilizes sentiment analysis of news articles to
automate trading decisions, aiming to capitalize on sentiment-driven market movements.
By integrating with the Alpaca API for execution and Yahoo finance for backtesting, it provides
a comprehensive framework for testing and deploying automated trading strategy.
